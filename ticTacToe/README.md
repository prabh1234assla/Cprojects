# TIC TAC TOE game created in C language. It is an open source project.

> Features :
1.) It has a pointer that moves about a 3x3 grid using the **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT** and **DOWN** buttons 
---
2.) It has a *flash feature*. Once the pointer goes out of bounds of the grid, white flash is generated. This effect is better seen in an IDE terminal like VS Code terminal. 
---
=> Also, re-entering the same choice by the same player after he has played his turn will **generate a flash again**.
